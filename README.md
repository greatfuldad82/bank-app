Project Title: Full Stack MERN Banking Application

Description:  I employed this project in order to learn the full MERN stack - which includes : 

                                      MongoDB
                                      Express
                                      REACT
                                      Node.js
                                      
Installation and Instructions:
              
              clone the project into an empty directory on your local machine using git documentation to do so..
              
              start with npm init in the terminal or command line interface. 
              
              simply hit enter through all
              the questions that you are prompted with.
              
              make sure you have npm installed -   node -v should tell you if you have installed it or not.  
              
              run, npm i express
                   npm i mongodb
                   npm i nodemon (this ensures we don't have to stop and restart the server locally any time there is a change in the code)
                   
              to run the app, npm start, as i have installed a "start":"nodemon index.js" line in the package.json file
              
              that will spin up a server at localhost: 3001, as that is how i have denoted it in the project. 
              
              click through the app.. add yourself as a user.. login.  make deposits and withdrawals and see your
              balance change.. 
              
              To see the back end, download Docker and create an account if you don't have one..
              Download Robo3T  which is a graphic user interface that displays how the app is connecting
              through MongoDB.. As you add users, you will see them appear in the database if you right click on
              'Users' within Robo 3T app - make sure to read proper documentation on how to run a container in Docker
              once you have run the app.. once you do so, you will then be able to connect to the container via the 
              Robo 3T GUI.  Enjoy and thank you.  :)
              
              i would like to implement more functionality such as transaction logs.. special authorization for
              bank employees, and more styling for sure.  The main thing to focus on was the initial functionality,
              as that is the most challenging part to hack through.
